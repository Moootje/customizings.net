## Welcome to Customizations.org

### Here you will find several customizations of extension for content management systems perferably Joomla

This list of customizations for extensions will be expanded from time to time. So that you can add your customizations to the directory, this page synchronizes with GitHub. If you are not familiar with GitHub, you will find a tutorial on the following page, which can be used to expand the page to include your own customization. To access the repository, please contact me via email at sabih@customizations.org and I will add you to the project. Each entry is marked with a link to your page and you as the creator of the customization.

Each adaptation has been tested for functionality and the version of the software can be found directly on the page of the entry. Because most of the customizations are not provided by the developer, we can not guarantee compatibility with other extensions. Support for these adjustments is therefore excluded. Since we usually present commercial extensions here, a functioning with software from doubtful sources is not easy to predict. If you like the extension, buy it!
